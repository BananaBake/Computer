# Computer

Just a nice configured computer ðŸ–¤

A ready-to-use development environment featuring:

- XFCE desktop environment
- VNC and noVNC (browser-based remote desktop)
- Pre-installed Firefox browser
- Onboard on-screen keyboard
- Wine for running Windows applications

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new Codespace** on this repo with one click:

   [![Open in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=999234424&machine=standardLinux32gb&ref=main)
   
> [!NOTE]
> For optimal performance, the one-click Codespaces button above automatically selects a 4 CPU machine.

2. **Alternatively, clone this repository and open it in a Dev Container-compatible environment**  
   (such as GitHub Codespaces or VS Code with the Dev Containers extension):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BananaBake/Computer.git
    ```

3. The environment will start XFCE and expose:
   - VNC on port `5901`
   - noVNC Web Client on port `6080`

You can access the desktop environment in your browser at:  
[`http://localhost:6080`](http://localhost:6080)

> [!WARNING]
> VNC access is passwordless for convenience. This is insecure for public or shared environmentsâ€”do not expose these ports to the internet!
